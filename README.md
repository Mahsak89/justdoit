# Technologies Used

## Languages Used

- [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)

- [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)

- [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)
- [react](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/react)

- [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))
## Frameworks & Libraries

- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
  - This website is built using Django, a high-level Python web framework. Lonely House features multiple apps with model, view and template layers. I have also used Django to provide an admin view, create forms and test my website. Further features used include [Django Allauth](https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for user authentification, Pillow for uploading images, and Crispy Forms.

## Frameworks & Libraries

- [react Bootstrap 4](https://react-bootstrap-v4.netlify.app/components) 
  - I used bootstrap throughout the site to make it responsive. The website uses Bootstrap's Containers, Grid System, Flexbox and Spacing utilities. I sourced code from the Bootstrap documentation when building the Navbar, Image Carousels, Cards and Buttons.

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
  - Fonts are imported from google fonts.

## Storage & Hosting

- [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login)
  - Heroku is the deployment source I used for this project.

- [Github](https://github.com/)
  - Github was used to create and store the project repository.


## IDE & Version Control

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
  - Git was used as a version control in the terminal.

* [codeanywhere](https://app.codeanywhere.com/)
  * codeanywhere was used to create my files and where I wrote the code.

## Other Tools

- ES7 snippet for more convinient
- prettier formater for more convinient
-  [coolors](https://coolors.co/) for more color pallete

- [Google Chrome Dev Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/)
  - Google Chrome's Dev Tools were used while building the project to test responsiveness and for debugging.
- [pexels](https://www.pexels.com/)
  - Unsplash was used to source the website imagery.

- [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/)
  - OpenAI's ChatGPT was used in part to generate servicess for business consulting.

## Testing & Code Validation

The following tools were used for testing and code validation. You can see results in the Testing section of this README.

- [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)
- [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

# Testing

- I have tested my app manually to check each page and function works also the was no problem according to  ESLint

# Deployment
* Log in to heroku.com and open the dashboard for your react application (remember this is separate from the DRF application that runs your API)
* Select the “Deploy” tab in the dashboard
* Scroll down to the bottom and then select “Deploy Branch”
* Wait for your build to complete (you can click “view build log” to watch the process in a larger window)
* When you see the message “deployed to Heroku” in the build log, click the “open app” button at the top of the page.

# Credits

## Code

### Code Institute:
  - I sourced the framework for this project from the Code Institute Boutique Ado walkthrough. I have customised my website wherever possible. My checkout, Stripe payments, webhooks and email verification are very similar to the walkthrough as I desired to focus more on making my website fit for my users goals, rather than adding any further checkout or payment functionality.

### Django:
  - I referred to the Django documentation whilst building my project. I found articles on [testing](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/testing/) and [making database queries](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/db/queries/) particularly useful.
### DRF 

### react Bootstrap:
  - I have used Bootstrap classes throughout my project, including for layout utilities and cards. I sourced code from the Bootstrap documentation when building the navbar, image carousels, and dropdowns. These were sourced through the [ react Bootstrap documentation](https://react-bootstrap-v4.netlify.app/components/)


### Stack Overflow: 
  

## Media
- I used Pexels for all my images

- Thank you to the Code Institute  Community for their encouragement and technical support.

- Thank you to the tutors and staff at Code Institute for their support.
- I used help to write my readme file from moments in code institute
